Cleverbot chat app with speech-recognition and playback

Imaginary Friend is a vocally-enhanced Python Cleverbot chat app, which uses CMU PocketSphinx for voice-recognition and the Google Translate API for text-to-speech.  This has been developed on Ubuntu Linux, with the goal of eventually porting to the Raspberry Pi.  This is very much an early, it-just-barely-works build, and I am interested to see where things go from here.
